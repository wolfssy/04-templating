#### Single-line Summary
**Today, John and Brandon paired together. It took about 1.5hrs**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. We first added the handlebars script tag. Which included taking all the key/value pairs from the object constructor function.
  2. We added the CDN script tag to access the handlebars library.
  3. Used the handlebars to render articles: 'get' the template using jQuery and then use the Handlebars.compile method to compile the template.
  4. Then we returned the filled in template to the DOM using return(this).
